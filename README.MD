# Hydroponics
[Hydroponics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroponics) is the technique of growing plants using a water-based nutrient solution rather than soil, and can include an aggregate substrate, or growing media, such as vermiculite, coconut coir, or perlite. Hydroponic production systems are used by small farmers, hobbyists, and commercial enterprises.

This project describes an easy to make hydroponics tower that can be used to grow crops like lettuce on a very small surface (about 30cm2).

# Materials needed:
All materials needed can be found in the [POM file](./POM.MD) included in this project.
Additionally, some parts need to be (3D) printed. The files can be found in the STLs directory.

## THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
